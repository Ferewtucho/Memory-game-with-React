Memory game build using React JS library. Components state is managed to respond to user events.

<ol>
<li>The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.</li>
<li>The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented on clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.</li>
<li>Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.</li>
<li>Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.</li>
</ol>
